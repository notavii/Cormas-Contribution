# Description

Cormas is a platform for agent-based modelling and simulations implemented in Pharo - a pure object-oriented programming environment.

Cormas was originally developed by the Green research unit (today part of UMR SENS) based on the years of field experience. Cormas was specifically developed to support Companion Modelling (ComMod) - a participatory approach that involves stakeholders in every step of model development and exploration.

Documentation and tutorials about Cormas are available on this website: https://cormas.org
