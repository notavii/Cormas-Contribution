  ## Run the Following code in Playground (Ctrl + O + P)

```st
  | canvas points size rows cols q r x y gridWidth gridHeight offsetX offsetY |
canvas := RSCanvas new. "Initialize the canvas"

"Define hexagon size and grid dimensions"
size := 20. "Radius of each hexagon (distance from center to corner)"
rows := 10. "Number of rows"
cols := 10. "Number of columns"

"Define hexagon shape (6 vertices with 30Â° rotation for pointy-top)"
points := Array new: 6.
1 to: 6 do: [ :i |
    | angle |
    angle := (i - 1) * 60 degreesToRadians.
    points at: i put: (size * ((angle + (30 degreesToRadians)) cos)) @ (size * ((angle + (30 degreesToRadians)) sin)).
].

"Calculate grid dimensions to determine center offset"
gridWidth := (cols * (size * (3 sqrt))) + (size * (3 sqrt) / 2).
gridHeight := rows * (size * 1.5).

"Calculate the offset to center the grid"
offsetX := gridWidth / -2. "Negative because we need to move left from center"
offsetY := gridHeight / -2. "Negative because we need to move up from center"

"Generate staggered hexagonal grid using odd-r offset coordinates"
0 to: rows - 1 do: [ :r | 
    0 to: cols - 1 do: [ :q | 
        | hex cellX cellY |
        
        "Create the hexagon"
        hex := RSPolygon new.
        hex points: points copy.
        hex color: Color green. "Fill color"
        hex borderColor: Color black; borderWidth: 2. "Border color and width"
        
        "Calculate base position with staggered offset"
        cellX := size * (3 sqrt) * q.
        cellY := size * (1.5 * r).
        
        "Apply staggered effect for odd rows"
        r odd ifTrue: [ cellX := cellX + (size * (3 sqrt) / 2) ].
        
        "Apply centering offset"
        cellX := cellX + offsetX.
        cellY := cellY + offsetY.
        
        hex position: cellX @ cellY.
        canvas add: hex.
    ].
].

"Display the canvas"
canvas open.

```
## Modifications

**You can change color, number of rows columns, radius of hexagons, and border width & its color.**

## To be added more....
